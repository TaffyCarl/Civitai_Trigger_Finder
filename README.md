Before going on with all the gibberish, Civitai LoRA Trigger Finder up to and including V5 (this version) is copyright Carl Bratcher aka Taffy_Carl, you are free to use it but not reverse engineer, modify, whatever it. While it's a free program, a donation of Buzz on Civitai would be nice ;-) If you see this in places other than Civitai, Github and Pure Fooocus AI on Facebook please let me know. Finally, NEVER PAY FOR IT, It's free apart from a Buzz donation grovel grovel :-)

The CivitAI LoRA Trigger Finder has been updated to Version 5, you can now change the output colour of the HTML file 'Dark, Light or System' - just remember that once you've set it, that's the colour the html output will always be unless you delete the html and start from scratch. You also now have the option to view the HTML,the TXT version, the JSON and the Not Found LoRA's text directly from the GUI.

In short each time you run it, it now reads from a json file instead of going backwards and forwards to Civitai, it will take a little longer on it's first run but after that all it's looking for are newly added LoRA's and if you watch as it's going through your LoRA's for new ones, you will see SKIPPING when it comes across something already in the list.

The HTML output file also now has a search function which makes it a damn site easier and a copy button for the trigger(s) of each LoRA so if you leave it open in a new tab when you are toying with AI, you can quickly get to the NSFW LoRA trigger words you want ðŸ˜‰

It (the trigger finder) used to over-write the existing files which was great until you managed to find a missing LoRA then added it to the json and html etc and then it proved a touch flaky so now it saves the files with a date and time addition so you know which is the most current one.
